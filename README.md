# About Peg-Solitaire
The standard game fills the entire board with pegs (marbles) except for the central hole. The objective is, making valid moves, to empty the entire board except for a solitary peg in the central hole â€¦ A valid move is to jump a peg orthogonally (at right angles) over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg. - Wikepedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire)
